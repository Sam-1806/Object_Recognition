# Image Classification Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Image Classification Project! This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification and object recognition using a carefully curated dataset. The goal is to create a model that can effectively categorize images into predefined classes.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: This directory contains the dataset, split into training and testing sets.
- **notebooks/**: Explore the Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- **src/**: Source code files reside here.
  - **train.py**: Script for training the CNN.
  - **predict.py**: Script for making predictions on new images.
- **models/**: Save your model weights in this directory.
- **requirements.txt**: Includes the list of project dependencies.
- **README.md**: The document you are currently reading, providing an overview, instructions, and documentation.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd image-classification-project
2. **Install dependencies:**
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Usage:**
   Training the Model-
      -Navigate to the src/ directory:
         cd src/
      -Run the training script:
         python train.py
4. **Results:**
     Model Accuracy: **95.45%**
